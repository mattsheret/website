      <h2>I help make clear, easy-to-use tools and services</h2>

      <p>I take complex ideas and make them simple and straightforward. Working with designers and developers, I'll test different approaches to copy and make sure a service works the way people expect it to.</p>

      <h3>Case study: Service Design Manual</h3>
      <p>Following the successful release of GOV.UK, the Government Digital Service committed to consolidating useful guidance into a Service Manual to pool cross-government knowledge. In a team of six people, I helped prototype the alpha, and after successful testing developed a live Beta and content guidelines that were adopted by teams throughout the civil service.</p>

      <p>The manual today is a much-used, much-iterated tool. It still meets the vision set out by then Director of Digital Mike Bracken, providing "<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/04/16/here-to-help/">a shared understanding about what good looks like... ensuring that every new or redesigned service that is launched on GOV.UK is of a consistent and high quality.</a>"</p>

      <h3>Case study: Last.fm app for Spotify</h3>
      <p>A few years ago, Spotify made a brief attempt at being a platform for an ecosystem of in-player apps. With little warning, a scant tech-spec and tight dealines, I worked with a tiny team at Last.fm to produce an app that made the most of Last.fm's user-driven data with Spotify's streaming service.</p>

      <p>Specific challenges we had to address included educated users about how Last.fm works, developing a super-streamlined sign-up flow, and delivering music discovery features that made sense in the context of Spotify's wider service.</p>

      <p>The app proved to be one of the best-loved of Spotify's launch apps. It was deactivated when Spotify began developing its own data-driven music discovery features.</p>
