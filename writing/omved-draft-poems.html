      <h1>Draft poems 26/9/23</h1>

      <p>Two poems read at OmVed gardens in Septmber 2023 (although I've edited <em>Unfurling</em> a bit since then).</p>

      <h2>Downdraft</h2>
      
      <p>Oaks sprawl, heat-heavy and tired.</p>
      <p>They hide the sight of jays retching 'hellos' across the canopy,</p>
      <p>And of a woodpecker,</p>
      <p>Wheezing away to itself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We're waiting on the downdraft</p>
      <p>– a swoop of pressure – </p>
      <p>To change the shape of the day.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Away from gulls (and their siren cry of chip-salt and wafer cones)</p>
      <p>Towards wet windows,</p>
      <p>A notebook</p>
      <p>The static of rainfall</p>
      <br>
      <p>The first fat drop knocks a wasp from the air.</p>
      <p>Dazed, it rests a beat on my chest,</p>
      <p>Dashes for cover.</p>
      <p>Then I'm away too.</p>

      <h2>Unfurling</h2>

      <p>Fox, unfurling, dappled sun drying the air.</p>
      <p>Feet push at dirt as she stretches,</p>
      <p>Dusty topsoil furrowing,</p>
      <p>Falling away,</p>
      <p>In crabapple shade.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The garden has changed.</p>
      <p>Rain burned off, a memory.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Fox remembers spring.</p>
      <p>Her coat, vibrant, glowed in spotlights</p>
      <p>As the city swelled around her.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Then – before – she moved quickly,</p>
      <p>Flitting between bright and gloom,</p>
      <p>Confident that every space was hers.</p>
      <p>Pressed close to vixens and dogs,</p>
      <p>Their heat and hers melting the night.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Fox loved that spring.</p>
      <p>Feels the lack of it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now fox shakes the heat off.</p>
      <p>Pads inside.</p>
      <p>Tiptoes into the den.</p>
      <p>Ignores the scattered scramble left by her pups at dawn</p>
      <p>Hours ago.</p>
      <br>
      <p>No trace of spring on her mate.</p>
      <p>None of its lustre.</p>
      <p>Just the leanness of this season,</p>
      <p>And the promise of more to come.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Fox remembers spring, and longs for her coat</p>
      
      <p></p>
