      <h1>The Bureau of Small Observation</h1>

      <p>Small Observation is a glimpse of what I saw between October 2014 and August 2016. A short-form writing project I ran through a newsletter, it's made up of things I noticed wherever I was in the world.</p>

      <p>Reading it now I can see a few clear phases: the bit where I was working out what I was doing; the bit where I got into a groove; the bit where I hit a rut; the gap; the new format; the finale.</p> 

      <p>There's a stretch where I tried to conjure how it felt to walk around Punchdrunk's epic <en>The Drowned Man</en>. There are a few glimpses of places I'd travelled for teaching gigs. There are a few friends. A few judgments I'm not so proud of.</p>

      <p>Every so often I think about revisiting the project, doing another round of noticing out loud. For now it's nice to put it all in one place.</p>
