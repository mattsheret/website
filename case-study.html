      <h2>This is a case study about building culture in digital teams</h2>

      <p>Great cultures reward new beginners, create a shared sense of mission and show off what makes a team special.</p>

      <p>I’ve been helping people do that since 2009.</p>

      <h3>Case study: GDS SPRINT events</h3>

      <p>Recognising that user-centred digital culture needed to blossom across the civil service, the GDS creative team developed a live events series called ‘Sprint’. I was involved from the start.</p>

      <p>SPRINT13 took place in January 2013 at the QEII Conference Centre. It was designed to kickstart activity across the civil service, so we developed a message around an ambitious goal: transform 25 exemplar services in two years.</p>

      <p>I was involved in incorporating this messaging into pre-event coverage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFTiJbkmFeU&t">a welcome film</a>, invites, signage, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gHbNvEW3Ws">post-event coverage</a>. I also helped helped speakers in breakout sessions develop and rehearse talks for the event.</p>

      <h3>Transforming Government Together</h3>

      <p>Each year the narrative evolved to focus on what we felt would be important to digital transformation. In 2015 I helped develop the core narrative around developing Government as a Platform, working to write and develop the ‘blocks’ video. This short film was used over the following year to explain the fundamental concept of platform technology to ministers, teams and the public.</p>

      <p>At the 2016 event we really drew focus on the work taking place across the civil service, reflecting the wider culture of transformation back to a diverse audience. I helped interview and edit these films, drawing out unique stories to share on the day and after the event.</p>

      <p>At this, the last SPRINT event I worked on, I helped develop a focus on collaborative, collective effort. This message – Transforming Government Together – played a key part in the event material, and formed the heart of the closing keynote I wrote for then Director of Digital Stephen Foreshew-Cain.</p>
