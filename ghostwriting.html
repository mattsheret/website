      <p>Since 2012 I've supported speakers giving talks around the world and ghostwritten articles that have shaped national policies.</p>

      <h3>Case study: BuckleyWilliams</h3>

      <p>Over the course of a year, product design studio BuckleyWilliams had built up a successful roster of projects but hadn't found time to document their work in public.</p>

      <p>I spent a day with Nat and Dan, learning about their work and proess and asking questions about specific projects. It was pretty quickly clear that, as a creative partnership, they were great at drawing out interesting facts and different perspectivs in each other.</p>

      <p>I gave them a framework for interviewing each other, and asked them to cover off each of their projects. The transcripts could be used to pull together case studies and blog posts, keeping the detail at a suitably high-level while also showing the unique creative partnership that drove the team.</p>
