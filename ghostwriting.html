      <p>Since 2012 I've helped speakers deliver high-quality talks around the world, and ghostwritten articles that have shaped national policies.</p>

      <h3>How I work</h3>
      <p>Whether you need a keynote speech written from scratch or a quick polish of a critical blog post, the journey is the same: listening, drafting, revising.</p>

      <p>If you're faced with a blank sheet of paper I can help you thumbnail an early draft, using a quick interview to draw out essential points. If you need a second pair of eyes on a keynote address, I can support you over a couple of sessions to rehearse the deck and smooth it out.</p>

      <p>Most of my work falls somewhere in between: working up notes, refining a draft with a client, and creating room for them to add the finishing touches.</p>
